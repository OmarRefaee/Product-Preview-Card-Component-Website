## My process

in this project after i ended making the html code i started to make the css layout then i started to look at the design image and my results and made every signle edit to make it be as the design identically.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 Styling
- Flexbox Layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

one new thing i learned in this project which is you can change img src on different screen size not using backgorund-image: URL("example.com"); property but using this:

```html
<img src="images/favicon-32x32.png"
      srcset="images/image-product-mobile.jpg 1000w,
      images/image-product-desktop.jpg 2000w">
```

```css
border-top-right-radius: value;
```

### Continued development

what i want to focus on as i said in the previous project if really someone read the previous project's "README" i want to focus on timing i want to complete the projects faster than am i now everything is simple i don't need to take long time making it.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped for learning more about css properties.
